 *
 * Note, that if this function is called before the serial_waitforevent(),
 * then the next invocation of serial_waitforevent() will abort
 * immediately. This is by design to avoid race conditions. Consider the case
 * that a thread has collected its data and has determined that there is
 * nothing to write. So it calls serial_waitforevent() with the event of only
 * READEVENT. Immediately before it calls serial_waitforevent(), a separate
 * thread has determined that there is data to write, and calls
 * serial_abortwaitforevent(). That causes the function serial_waitforevent()
 * to exit immediately (and possible return data that is available) to then
 * process the next command that is also to write data. If it were to discard
 * this method before calling waitforevent, it would actually miss the fact
 * that there is data to write and may end up in a blocking loop forever.
 *
 * To see how this works, assume you have two threads. Thread 1 is responsible
 * for looping always ready to read data (assuming that buffer space is
 * available) and based on a flag, it might also want to send data. It has
 * pseudo code that looks like:
 *
 * \code{.c}
void readwriteeventloop(void) {
  serialevent_t event = NOEVENT;

  while (running) {
    event = IsDataAvailable() ? WRITEEVENT : NOEVENT;

    serialevent_t gotevent =
      serial_waitforevent(handle, READEVENT | event, -1);

    if (gotevent & READEVENT) {
      // Read from the serial port
    }

    if (gotevent & WRITEEVENT) {
      // Write to the serial port
    }
  }
}
 * \endcode
 *
 * In a separate thread, say Thread 2, there might be a function called when
 * write data is now placed in a buffer, ready for sending:
 *
 * \code{.c}
void onwritedataavailable(void)
{
  GetData();
  serial_abortwaitforevent(handle);
}
 * \endcode
 *
 * Thus, you can see it is important that when data arrives the current
 * serial_waitforevent() exits, so that it can process whatever data it has,
 * and reenter the loop with the flag modified to also write data.
 *
 * The serial_abortwaitforevent() uses mutexes internally to serialize data,
 * so it also behaves as a memory barrier, ensuring that variables (like event
 * in the above example) are correctly set. But you will still have to make
 * sure that you control race conditions in your own program. That is why we
 * don't modify the event flag in Thread 2. The methods GetData() and
 * IsDataAvailable() need to apply appropriate synchronisation.
 *
 * \param handle The handle returned by serial_init()
 * \return -1 if there was an error. Use errno to get the error code.
 * \return 0 on success.

/*! \brief Read data from the serial port.
 *
 * Read data from the serial port and copy into the buffer. This read method
 * behaves a little differently to the way normal posix read() works. The read
 * is always non-blocking. If there is no data to read, the value 0 is
 * returned, which is not to be misinterpreted as end of file. If the serial
 * port has been closed for whatever reason, the errno EIO is returned and the
 * appropriate error message is set. The amount of bytes returned may be less
 * than the length of the buffer provided.
 *
 * The reason why the behaviour is changed is so that the programmer doesn't
 * need to rely or check the specific value of errno, simply getting an error
 * is enough to know there is a problem and no data is available. The second
 * reason is this library attempts to be compatible to .NET, which will
 * happily return 0 for no data (as well as end of file) in non-blocking
 * situations of which errno EWOULDBLOCK / EAGAIN is not a reason to raise an
 * exception. So get a value of -1 and we have an exception.
