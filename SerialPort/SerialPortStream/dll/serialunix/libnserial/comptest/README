The Component test tests sending and receiving data, that the connection is
reliable.

Prerequisites:
* The unit test cases in the 'unittest' folder of this library should be run
  first and work as expected. Failures there will explain some initialisation
  failures that may be seen with this component test.

Requirements:
* You will need a NULL modem cable connected between two serial ports on your
  computer. They could be a 16550A or a USB serial port, doesn't matter, so
  long as it fully compatible with Linux. If it isn't then this component
  test might find issues.

Execution:
* With appropriate permissions, you want to run the component test with paths
  to the serial devices as parameters.

e.g.

  ./nserialcomptest /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyUSB1

The Google test framework will execute and show you the results. For example:
